## Best Practices

<a id="great-issues"></a>

### GitHub Best Practice

- Creating and curating issues
    - Read ["About Issues"][about-issues]
    - Issues should be focused and actionable
    - Complex issues should be broken down into simpler issues where possible
- Pull Requests
    - Read ["About Pull Requests"][about-pulls]
    - Pull Requests (PRs) should be atomic and aim to close a single issue
    - Long running PRs should be avoided where possible
    - PRs should reference issues following standard conventions (e.g. "fixes #123")
    - Always work on a feature branch, never directly on main
    - PRs should be reviewed and merged in a timely fashion
    - PRs that do not pass GitHub actions should never be merged

### Data Ingest Best Practices

- **Configuration Management**
    - Keep `download.yaml`, `transform.yaml`, and `metadata.yaml` files properly formatted
    - Validate YAML syntax before committing changes
    - Document all configuration parameters
- **Transform Code**
    - Follow Python best practices in `transform.py`
    - Add appropriate error handling and logging
    - Write unit tests for transform logic
- **Data Quality**
    - Validate output data against expected schema
    - Include data quality checks in transforms
    - Document any data cleaning or filtering applied
- **Dependencies**
    - Keep dependencies up to date
    - Only add necessary dependencies
    - Use version pinning for reproducibility
